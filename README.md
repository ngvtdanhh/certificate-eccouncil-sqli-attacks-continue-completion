## 📝 Course Review

This course provides a hands-on and technical overview of SQL Injection attacks from basic to advanced levels. Ideal for web app pentesters, bug bounty hunters, and developers interested in defensive coding.

✅ **What I liked**:
- Deep dive into multiple types of SQLi
- PostgreSQL stack-based examples
- Real-world exploitation scenarios

📌 **Suggestions**:
- Include labs with public test environments
- Add modules on WAF bypasses and evasion
